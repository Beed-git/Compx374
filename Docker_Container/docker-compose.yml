#Apparently no longer ideal to define a version

#There's lots of test stuff, including the volumes section, that are just there as I'm following a tutorial

# Ok so bear with me
# I think we need 4 different containers (if the database were to move to this server, 3 if not)
# For the following:
# - PHP script-runner
# - NGINX ?host? thing to access PHP-script based website
# - WebAPI
# - (Database if it's on this server)
# - Reverse proxy to act as entry to all of them
# We DON'T need a MySQL database paired with the PHP

#      MYSQL_PASSWORD: 'secret'
#      # Name of a schema that'll be created, which that ^^ user has access to
#      MYSQL_DATABASE: 'tutorial'
#    volumes:
#      - mysqldata:/var/lib/mysql
#    ports:    #For connecting to a client such as MySQL Workbench for managing the database (not set up). PHPMyAdmin is another option but the author recommended against it
#      - 3306:3306
#
#This creates a different database that's not linked to
# the existing local file system, so that edits in the live server 
# don't affect the real database on your file system...
# for development/testing
#Volumes is a special kind of volume that isn't linked
#volumes:
#  mysqldata: {}

# Things to consider checking in the docs
#   hostname
#   logging
#   restart
#   volumes (can be used across multiple services)
