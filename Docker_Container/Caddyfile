# use "caddy reload" in the container to reload config

# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

# tuakiri.trex-sandwich.com 

:31337, tuakiri.trex-sandwich.com:31337 {
	# Set this path to your site's directory.
	root * /var/www/html

	# Enable the static file server.
	#file_server

	# Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
	reverse_proxy localhost:4002

	# Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
	# php_fastcgi localhost:9000
}
